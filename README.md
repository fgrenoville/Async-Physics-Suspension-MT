# Asynchronous vehicle physics in UE5 that scales with multithreading

![Unreal Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unreal%20Engine-%23313131.svg?logo=unrealengine&logoColor=white)

I reworked the original [Async-Physics-Suspension](https://github.com/fgrenoville/Async-Physics-Suspension) project to simulate multiple vehicles in parallel, with a strict split between Game Thread (GT) and Physics Thread (PT) data to keep the plugin's workflow fully aligned with Unreal Engine 5 guidelines and best practices

Each vehicle owns its own input/output buffers and a PT-only internal state. All physics functionality now lives inside a dedicated plugin: SmokinWheelsPhx.

## What‚Äôs in this repo

- The SmokinWheelsPhx plugin (per-scene Chaos management, GT ‚Üî PT buffers, per-vehicle parallel step).
- A sample project with a tiny UI to quickly test features and compare single-thread vs parallel performance.


## Architecture at a glance

- Per-scene ownership: one manager per FPhysScene; it registers GT hooks (ScenePreTick, ScenePostTick) and the PT sim callback (OnPreSimulate_Internal).
- GT‚ÜîPT contract: GT writes Input, PT writes Output‚Äîthey exchange packets via lock-free queues. No UObjects on PT.
- Identity & handles: FGuid routes data across threads; FUniqueIdx correlates the rigid body in the solver; handles are cached and validated each step.
- Parallelism: one vehicle = one iteration; each iteration reads/writes only its own slot ‚Üí lock-free inner loop.


Tip: If you‚Äôre GPU/Render-bound, parallel physics improves capacity and stability but may not increase FPS. Use Unreal Insights / stat unit to confirm where the bottleneck is.

## Profiling & CVars

- Show plugin stats:
```text
stat SmokinWheelsPhx
```


![StatImage](./GitHubAssets/StatThmb.png)


- Toggle single-thread execution:
```text
swp.ForceSingleThread true   // single-thread path
swp.ForceSingleThread false  // Chaos::PhysicsParallelFor
```
- Toggle debug drawing:
```text
swp.DebugDraw.Enable true
swp.DebugDraw.Enable false
```
- Change line thickness scale:
```text
swp.DebugDraw.ThicknessScale 0..N   // e.g., swp.DebugDraw.ThicknessScale 1.5
```
- Filter drawings by category:

The plugin can filter debug drawing by category. Currently only Suspension is used, but other categories are already defined (e.g., Engine, Aero, Transmission).
```text
swp.DebugDraw.Cats [Suspension, Engine, Aero...]
```
